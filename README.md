Precise 6-DoF Electromagnetic Controller Tracking

Aura is an inside-out electromagnetic 6-DoF tracking system for handheld controllers. The tracking system consists of three coils embedded in a head- mounted display and a set of orthogonal receiver coils embedded in a handheld controller. We propose a novel closed-form and com- putationally simple tracking approach to reconstruct position and orientation in real time.
